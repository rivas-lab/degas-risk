## Figures

This folder contains jupyter notebooks which generated the main figures for the manuscript. They are provided as-is for replication and future analysis.

### Note on individual-level data

Since we are unable to share individual-level UK Biobank data, it will not be possible to use these notebooks as-is until other [analyses](../scripts) are re-run locally. In principle, however, these notebooks can be used for future studies, should there be interest in replicating these figures â€” using UK Biobank data or otherwise.
