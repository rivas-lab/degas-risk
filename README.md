# Polygenic risk modeling with DeGAs

This is the repository for "[Polygenic risk modeling with latent trait-related genetic components](https://doi.org/10.1101/808675)" (Aguirre et. al. 2020). Briefly, this project sought to build and evaluate polygenic risk models using a previously described application of Truncated Singular Value Decomposition to GWAS summary statitstics, called [DeGAs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6731283/) (Tanigawa et. al. 2019). Please refer to these manuscripts for a description of our methods and findings.

Here, you will find code which produced most of the work for this project. The folders of this repository contain the primary analysis [scripts](scripts), the [reference](reference) information they rely upon, and code used to make [figures](figures) and results for the main text and [supplement](supplement) of our manuscript. Each folder also has a readme which details its contents. Thank you for visiting this page!
